You have to create a class, named Student, representing the student's details, as mentioned above, and store the data of a student. Create setter and getter functions for each element; that is, the class should at least have following functions:

get_age, set_age
get_first_name, set_first_name
get_last_name, set_last_name
get_standard, set_standard
Also, you have to create another method to_string() which returns the string consisting of the above elements, separated by a comma(,). You can refer to stringstream for this.

__Input Format__

Input will consist of four lines.
The first line will contain an integer, representing the age. The second line will contain a string, consisting of lower-case Latin characters ('a'-'z'), representing the first_name of a student.
The third line will contain another string, consisting of lower-case Latin characters ('a'-'z'), representing the last_name of a student.
The fourth line will contain an integer, representing the standard of student.

Note: The number of characters in first_name and last_name will not exceed 50.

__Output Format__

The code provided by HackerRank will use your class members to set and then get the elements of the Student class.

__Sample Input__
```
15

carmack
10
```
__Sample Output__
```
15
carmack, john
